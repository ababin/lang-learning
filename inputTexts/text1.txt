She insisted that deterring other countries from leaving the EU should not be a priority in the talks.
And she added she was not in favour of pushing for a speedy withdrawal.
Britain narrowly voted to end its membership in a historic referendum last Thursday.
Mrs Merkel was speaking after several EU foreign ministers - including Germany's - had urged Britain to quickly implement its exit.
"It shouldn't take forever, that's right, but I would not fight for a short timeframe," she said.
She added that she was seeking an "objective, good" climate in the talks with Britain, which "must be conducted properly".
